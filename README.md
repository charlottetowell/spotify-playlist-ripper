# Spotify Playlist Ripper

A Flask app that authorises with Spotify's web API to extract your playlist & track information into a downloadable JSON file.

**Why?** Because it beats waiting "up to 30 days" for Spotify to email you a bulk data export of your account [ðŸ”—](https://support.spotify.com/au/article/understanding-my-data/)

4. Populate .env with your own variables from Spotify   

5. Run the server locally via `python main.py`

The server will start at `http://127.0.0.1:8080`
